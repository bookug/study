Use Latex formula in word

直接编辑tex文件中的$$xx$$可以写公式，生成pdf后用acrobat裁剪公式部分，再导出为word格式，即可将公式的矢量图在word中使用

Use Latex formula in visio

For example, we need the formula symbol theta.
open pdf in illustartor, and save as svg or emf(or wmf).
Then, better to open it in visio rather than insert as image, and we can edit it to modify the font of theta as Times New Roman, as well as its size.
This is really a vector graph, wrappered as a Text Frame, and can be copied to other visio files.
