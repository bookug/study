		StringTemplate is a java template engine for generating source code,
web pages, emails, or any other formatted text output.

StringTemplate is particularly good at multi-targeted code generators,
multiple site skins, and internationalization/localization. 

It evolved over years of effort developing jGuru.com. 

StringTemplate also generates the stringtemplate website: http://www.stringtemplate.org
and powers the ANTLR v3 code generator. Its distinguishing characteristic 
is that unlike other engines, it strictly enforces model-view separation.

Strict separation makes websites and code generators more flexible
and maintainable; it also provides an excellent defense against malicious
template authors.

There are currently about 600 StringTemplate source downloads a month.
