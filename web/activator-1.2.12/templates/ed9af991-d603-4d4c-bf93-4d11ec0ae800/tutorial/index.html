<div>
    <p>You've just created a simple Akka application! Now lets explore the code and make some changes.</p>
    <p>
    In short, <a href="http://akka.io">Akka</a> is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent,
    distributed, and fault-tolerant event-driven applications on the JVM. Akka can be used with both Java
    and Scala. One of the most powerful features of Akka is its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">
    Actor Model</a> of concurrency, which you will learn more about in this tutorial.
    </p>
    <p>Akka can be used from either Java or Scala and this tutorial has both Java and Scala sample code.</p>

    <h2>Source code</h2>

    <p>
    The <a href="#code/src/main/java" class="shortcut">java</a> directory contains the Java
    source code <a href="#code/src/main/java/HelloAkkaJava.java" class="shortcut">HelloAkkaJava.java</a>
    and the <a href="#code/src/main/scala" class="shortcut">scala</a> directory contains the Scala
    source code <a href="#code/src/main/scala/HelloAkkaScala.scala" class="shortcut">HelloAkkaScala.scala</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The sample in this tutorial is pretty simple; it consists of a <code>Greeter</code> Actor who holds
    onto the latest defined <code>greeting</code> string and can respond to two actions; set a new greeting
    string and return the latest greeting string.
    </p>
    <p>
    Next let's get started.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Define our Messages</h2>
    <p>
    An Actor does not have a public API in terms of methods that you can invoke. Instead its public
    API is defined through messages that the actor handles. Messages can be of arbitrary
    type (any subtype of <code>Object</code> in Java or <code>Any</code> in Scala).  This means that we
    can send boxed primitive values (such as <code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code>,
    <code>Boolean</code> etc.) as messages or plain data structures like arrays and
    collection types. However, since the messages are the Actor's public API, you should define
    messages with good names and rich semantic and domain specific meaning, even if it's just wrapping
    your data type. This will make it easier to use, understand and debug actor-based systems.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now we want to define three different messages;
     <ul>
      <li><code>WhoToGreet</code> redefines the new greeting</li>
      <li><code>Greet</code> asks the Actor for latest greeting</li>
      <li><code>Greeting</code> returns the latest greeting</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Let's start by defining the messages in Java (we are putting them inside an outer <a href="#code/src/main/java/HelloAkkaJava.java"
    class="shortcut">HelloAkkaJava</a> class,
    containing our full sample). It is <b>very important</b> that the messages we create are immutable (meaning that
    they cannot be changed), if not we run the risk of accidentally sharing state between two different Actors
    which will violate the Actor Model. In this sample we will not use any remoting, but it is a good practice to
    always mark your messages as <code>Serializable</code> since then you will not run in to any runtime issues if
    you decide to scale out (on to multiple nodes) with Akka but forget to go back and reimplement your messages.
        <pre><code>
// Java code

public static class Greet implements Serializable {}

public static class WhoToGreet implements Serializable {
    public final String who;
    public WhoToGreet(String who) {
        this.who = who;
    }
}

public static class Greeting implements Serializable {
    public final String message;
    public Greeting(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }
}
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    This is the way we would define the messages in Scala.  In Scala case classes and case objects make
    excellent messages since they are immutable and have support for pattern matching, something we will
    take advantage of in the Actor when matching on the messages it has received. Another advantage case
    classes has is that they are marked as serializable by default.
        <pre><code>
// Scala code

case object Greet
case class WhoToGreet(who: String)
case class Greeting(message: String)
        </code></pre>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Define our Actor</h2>

    <p>
    The Actor is the unit of execution in Akka.  Actors are object-oriented in the sense that they encapsulate
    state and behavior, but they have much stronger isolation than regular objects in Java or Scala. The Actor
    model prevents sharing state between Actors and the only way to observe another actor's state is by sending
    it a message asking for it. Actors are extremely lightweight, they are only constrained by memory of which
    they consume only a few hundred bytes each &#8212; this means you can easily create millions of concurrent
    Actors in a single application. Their strong isolation principles together with the event-driven model (that
    we will talk about later on) and location transparency makes it easy to solve hard concurrency and scalability
    problems in an intuitive way.
    </p>
    <p>
    You create an Actor in Java by defining a class that extends <code>UntypedActor</code> and implement the
    <code>onReceive</code> method (in Scala you have to extend <code>Actor</code> trait and implement the
    <code>receive</code> method). It is in the <code>onReceive</code> method that you define the behavior; how
    the Actor should react to the different messages it receives.  An Actor can have &#8212; and often has &#8212;
    state.  Accessing or mutating the internal state of an Actor is fully thread safe since protected by the Actor model.
    </p>
    <p>
    So, let's now create a <code>Greeter</code> Actor with a single variable <code>greeting</code> as its state, holding on to the latest
    defined greeting, and in its <code>onReceive</code> method let's add the behavior for how it should react upon receiving
    the <code>WhoToGreet</code> and the <code>Greet</code> messages.
    </p>
    <p>
    Let's start by creating our Actor in Java (you can find the code in the <a href="#code/src/main/java/HelloAkkaJava.java"
     class="shortcut">HelloAkkaJava.java</a> file):
        <pre><code>
// Java code

public static class Greeter extends UntypedActor {
    String greeting = "";

    public void onReceive(Object message) {
        if (message instanceof WhoToGreet)
            greeting = "hello, " + ((WhoToGreet) message).who;

        else if (message instanceof Greet)
            getSender().tell(new Greeting(greeting), getSelf());

        else unhandled(message);
    }
}
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    Actors like this one are “untyped” in the sense that the type of message received is not restricted—it is 
    <code>Object</code> as shown above. There are also typed actors, but we will 
    not concern ourselves with those now, the normal actors are the untyped ones.
    </p>
    <p>
    Don't worry about the <code>getSender()</code>, <code>tell(..)</code> and <code>getSelf()</code> API calls,
    we will get to that soon when we talk about sending and replying to messages.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now let's implement it in Scala. As you can see, Scala's pattern matching features really simplify working
    with Actors, but apart from that it's pretty similar to the Java version (you can find the code in the
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/HelloAkkaScala.scala" class="shortcut">HelloAkkaScala.scala</a> file).
        <pre><code>
// Scala code

class Greeter extends Actor {
  var greeting = ""

  def receive = {
    case WhoToGreet(who) => greeting = s"hello, $who"
    case Greet           => sender ! Greeting(greeting)
  }
}
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    You will notice one difference to the Java version: here we do not
    explicitly pass unhandled messages to the <code>unhandled()</code> method.
    This is not necessary since the behavior defined by the
    <code>receive</code> method is expressed as a so-called <em>partial
      function</em>, which means that all messages for which no matching
    <code>case</code> statement is written down will be recognized as being not
    handled and Akka will automatically pass them to the
    <code>unhandled()</code> method for you.
    </p>
    <p>
    Another difference is that the trait from which the Scala actor inherits is just called
    <code>Actor</code>. This is the Scala API while <code>UntypedActor</code> is the Java API
    for the same kind of actor.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Create our Actor</h2>

    <p>
    So far we have defined our Actor and its messages. Now let's create an instance of this actor. In Akka you can't
    create an instance of an Actor the regular way using <code>new</code>, instead you create it using a factory. What is
    returned from this factory is not an instance of the Actor itself but an <code>ActorRef</code> pointing to our actor
    instance.
    </p>
    <p>
    This level of indirection adds a lot of power and flexibility. It enables for example location transparency
    meaning that the <code>ActorRef</code> can, while retaining the same semantics, represent an instance of the running actor
    in-process or on a remote machine. I.e. location doesn't matter. This also means that the runtime can if needed
    optimize the system by changing an actor's location or the application's topology while it is running. Another
    thing that this level of indirection enables is the "let it crash" model of failure management in which the
    system can heal itself by crashing and restarting faulty actors.
    </p>
    <p>
    This factory in Akka is the <code>ActorSystem</code> and is to some extent similar to Spring's <code>BeanFactory</code>
    in that it also acts as a container for your Actors, managing their life-cycles etc.  You create an Actor through the
    <code>actorOf</code> factory method. This method takes a configuration object called <code>Props</code> and a name.
    Actor (and ActorSystem) names are important in Akka, you use them for example when looking Actors up as well as when you
    configure them in the <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.0/general/configuration.html">configuration
    file</a>, so you should take your time giving your Actors good names.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is the code that we have to write in Java:
        <pre><code>
// Java code

final ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create("helloakka");
final ActorRef greeter = system.actorOf(Props.create(Greeter.class), "greeter");
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    The Scala code is not much different:
        <pre><code>
// Scala code

val system = ActorSystem("helloakka")
val greeter = system.actorOf(Props[Greeter], "greeter")
          </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    Now we have a running instance of a <code>Greeter</code> actor. Next we will learn how to communicate with it.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Tell the Actor (to do something)</h2>

    <p>
    All communication with Actors is done through asynchronous message passing. This is what makes Actors
    reactive and event driven. An Actor doesn't do anything unless it's been told to do something, and you
    tell it to do something by sending the message. Sending a message asynchronously means that the sender
    does not stick around waiting for the message to be processed by the recipient actor. Instead the Actor
    hands the message off by putting it on the recipient's mailbox and is then free to do something more
    important than waiting for the recipient to react on the message. The actor's mailbox is essentially a
    message queue and has ordering semantics, this guarantees that the ordering of multiple messages sent
    from the same Actor is preserved, while they can be interleaved with the messages sent by another actor.
    </p>
    <p>
    You might be wondering what the Actor is doing when it is not processing messages, i.e. doing actual work?
    It is in a suspended state in which it does not consume any resources apart from memory.
    </p>
    <p>
    You tell an Actor to do something by passing in a message into the <code>tell</code> method on the
    <code>ActorRef</code>. This method puts the message on the actor's mailbox and then returns immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>
// Java code

greeter.tell(new WhoToGreet("akka"), ActorRef.noSender());
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>
// Scala code

greeter.tell(WhoToGreet("akka"), ActorRef.noSender)
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    If you are using Akka from Scala then you can also use the alias; <code>!</code>, called the bang operator.
        <pre><code>
// Scala code

greeter ! WhoToGreet("akka")
        </code></pre>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Replying to an Actor</h2>

    <h3>The 'self' reference</h3>

    <p>
    Sometimes the communication pattern is not just a one-way style of communication but instead lends
    itself towards request-reply. One explicit way of doing that is by adding a reference of yourself as part
    of the message so the receiver can use that reference to send a reply back to you. This is such a common
    scenario that it is directly supported by Akka; for every message you send you have the option of passing
    along the sender reference (the Actor's <code>ActorRef</code>).  If you are sending a message from within
    an Actor then you have access to your own <code>ActorRef</code> through <code>self</code> reference, please
    note that you should never use <code>this</code>. In Java you can access the self reference through the
    <code>getSelf()</code> method, while you can use <code>self</code> in Scala.
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>
// Java code

// From within an Actor
greeter.tell(new Greet(), getSelf());
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    In Scala this is simplified a bit. Scala has something called
    <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/114">implicit parameters</a> which allows you to automatically and
    transparently pass in parameters into methods, a feature that we are taking advantage of here to automatically
    pass along the sender reference when you send a message to another Actor.
    </p>
    <p>
    This code will, if invoked from within Actor 'A' automatically pass along the <code>ActorRef</code> of
    Actor 'A' as the sender of this message:
        <pre><code>
// Scala code

// From within an Actor
greeter ! Greet
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    If you choose not to pass in a sender reference into the <code>tell</code> method, or forget it, then a reference to
    the 'dead-letter' Actor will be used. The 'dead-letter' Actor is where all unhandled messages end up, and
    you can use Akka's <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.0/java/event-bus.html">Event Bus</a> to subscribe on them.
    </p>

    <h3>The 'sender' reference</h3>

    <p>
    This sender reference will then be available in the receiver Actor when it's processing the message. Since
    each message is paired with its unique sender reference, the "current" sender reference will change with each
    new message you process. So if you for some reason need to use a specific sender reference later then you have
    to hold on to it, storing it away in a member field or similar. In Java you can access it using the
    <code>getSender()</code> method (while you can use <code>sender</code> in Scala).
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>
// Java code

// From within the Greeter Actor
getSender().tell(new Greeting(greeting), getSelf());
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>
// Scala code

// From within the Greeter Actor
sender ! Greeting(greeting)
        </code></pre>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Using Inbox</h2>

    <p>
    Most real-world Actor applications make use of more than one Actor. The inventor of the Actor Model,
    Carl Hewitt, recently said in an interview that; "One Actor is no Actor. Actors come in systems."
    This is important wisdom. To truly leverage the Actor Model you should use lots of Actors. Every hard
    problem in Actor programming can be solved by adding more Actors; by breaking down the problem into
    subtasks and delegate by handing them to new Actors.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, for simplicity we are just using a single Actor in this sample. This means that if we communicate
    with this single actor from a <code>main</code> program then we have no <code>sender</code>, since we are
    not communicating with the Actor from within another Actor. Luckily Akka has a nice solution to this problem;
    <code>Inbox</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    <code>Inbox</code> allows you to create an "actor-in-a-box", i.e. it contains an Actor which can be used as a puppet
    for sending messages to other Actors and receiving their replies. You can create an <code>Inbox</code> using
    <code>Inbox.create</code> and send messages from it using <code>inbox.send</code>. The internal Actor will just
    put any message it receives into a queue from which it can be retrieved by calling <code>inbox.receive</code>;
    if the queue is empty then that call will block until a message becomes available. Pretty simple.
    </p>
    <p>
    As you probably know, blocking is something that can really inhibit performance and scalability, and that
    you should use very sparingly and with care. That said, we are making use of it in this sample since it
    simplifies the sample and makes it very easy to follow the message flow.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now let's complete this tutorial by writing the driver code that will exercise our <code>Greeter</code> Actor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>
// Java code

// Create an "actor-in-a-box"
final Inbox inbox = Inbox.create(system);

// Tell the 'greeter' to change its 'greeting' message
greeter.tell(new WhoToGreet("akka"), ActorRef.noSender());

// Ask the 'greeter for the latest 'greeting'
// Reply should go to the mailbox
inbox.send(greeter, new Greet());

// Wait 5 seconds for the reply with the 'greeting' message
Greeting greeting = (Greeting) inbox.receive(Duration.create(5, "seconds"));
System.out.println("Greeting: " + greeting.message);
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>
// Scala code

// Create an "actor-in-a-box"
val inbox = Inbox.create(system)

// Tell the 'greeter' to change its 'greeting' message
greeter tell WhoToGreet("akka")

// Ask the 'greeter for the latest 'greeting'
// Reply should go to the mailbox
inbox.send(greeter, Greet)

// Wait 5 seconds for the reply with the 'greeting' message
val Greeting(message) = inbox.receive(5.seconds)
println(s"Greeting: $message")
        </code></pre>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Test the App</h2>

    <p>
    Both the Java and Scala examples each have unit tests in the <a href="#code/src/test" class="shortcut">test</a>
    directory.  The <a href="#code/src/test/java/HelloAkkaTest.java" class="shortcut">Java tests</a> use JUnit, while
    the <a href="#code/src/test/scala/HelloAkkaSpec.scala" class="shortcut">Scala tests</a> use ScalaTest.
    </p>
    <p>
    Both of these tests are making use of the excellent Akka
    <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.0/scala/testing.html" target="_blank">TestKit</a> module,
    which makes it so much easier to test and verify concurrent code.
    </p>
    <p>
    Making changes to the sample's source or the test source will cause the tests to be automatically re-run.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Run the App</h2>

    <p>
        Congratulations!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you have almost completed the tutorial and written a simple Akka application. If you have not looked
        at the full sample then now is a good time to do so.

<div>
    <h2>Inspect the App</h2>
    
    <p>
        Use <a href="#inspect" class="shortcut">Inspect</a> to see what is happening with the Actors in a running application.  This will contain a list of the Actors in the Actor System.  Drilling down into an individual Actor will display a number of statistics and information about the Actor.  Deviations will show you any issues with your Actors.
