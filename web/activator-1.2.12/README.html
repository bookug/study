<h1>Typesafe Activator Documentation</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Activator can be used from a web browser or from a command
line.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Launch Instructions</h2>
<p>Once installed you can run Typesafe Activator's UI either from a
file browser or from a command line. If you run the Activator UI
from within an application's root directory that application will
be automatically opened. The <code>activator</code> command is a
wrapper around <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">sbt</a> when
used from an existing application's root directory. When used
outside of a application directory you can either create a new
application by running <code>activator new</code> or launch the
UI.</p>
<h3>Launch the UI on Windows</h3>
<h4>From Windows Explorer</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the <code>activator.bat</code> file</li>
<li>Select "Open"</li>
<li>If prompted with a warning, select to continue</li>
</ol>
<h4>From a Command prompt</h4>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the directory containing the
<code>activator.bat</code> file</li>
<li>Run: <code>activator ui</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Launch the UI on Mac</h3>
<h4>From Finder</h4>
<ol>
<li>Ctrl-click or right-click on the <code>activator</code>
file</li>
<li>Select "Open"</li>
<li>When prompted, select "Open"</li>
</ol>
<h4>From Terminal</h4>
<ol>
<li>Navigate the the directory containing the
<code>activator</code> file</li>
<li>Run: <code>./activator ui</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Launch the UI on Linux</h3>
<h4>From a GUI file browser</h4>
<ol>
<li>Double-click on the <code>activator</code> file</li>
</ol>
<h4>From Terminal</h4>
<ol>
<li>Navigate the the directory containing the
<code>activator</code> file</li>
<li>Run: <code>./activator ui</code></li>
</ol>
<h2>The Activator UI</h2>
<p>Once you have launched the UI it can be reached in your browser
at: [http://localhost:8888]</p>
<h3>Creating New Applications</h3>
<p>If you have launched the UI outside of a application's root
directory you can now create a new application based on one of the
templates. Both Typesafe and the community have contributed
templates to Activator. <a href=
"http://typesafe.com/activator/template/contribute">Learn more
about how to contribute your own template</a></p>
<p>Once you have selected a template and optionally entered a name
and location, select the <em>Create</em> button to have your new
application created.</p>
<h3>Open an Existing Application Using the Web Interface</h3>
<p>Existing applications can be opened by running
<code>activator</code> or <code>activator.bat</code> from a
project's root directory. If the Activator UI is already running,
then open [http://localhost:8888/home] in your browser and either
select a known existing app, or click the <em>Find Existing</em>
button to browse to an existing app.</p>
<h3>Working with Applications in the Activator UI</h3>
<p>Once you have created or opened an application in the Activator
UI you can:<br>

* Read the Tutorial<br>

* Browse &amp; edit the code (select <em>Code</em>)<br>

* Open the code in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (select <em>Code</em>
then the <em>Open</em> dropdown)<br>

* See the compile output (select <em>Compile</em>)<br>

* Test the application (select <em>Test</em>)<br>

* Run the application (select <em>Run</em>)<br>

* Inspect Actors and Requests in Play Framework and Akka
applications (select <em>Inspect</em>)<br>

* Create a new application or open an existing one (select the
application's name in the top right, then select <em>Manage
Applications</em>)</p>
<p>Whenever you save changes to a source file in the application,
the changes will be recompiled, the application will be re-run, and
the tests will be re-run.</p>
<h3>Re-Launching Activator</h3>
<p>To make it easy to re-launch Activator (either from a file
browser or command line) after you've shut it down, you can either
launch it the same way you did the first time, or you can launch it
from the new application's root directory. If you launch it from
the application's root directory then the UI will automatically
launch with the application open. Otherwise you will need to open
the existing application. To make it easy for others to launch
Activator for your application you can put the
<code>activator</code>, <code>activator.bat</code>, and
<code>activator-launch-VERSION.jar</code> files in your SCM.</p>
<h2>Activator Configuration</h2>
<h3>Proxy Configuration</h3>
<p>When running activator behind a proxy, some additional
configuration is needed. Open the
<code>~/.activator/activatorconfig.txt</code> file in a text editor
(creating it if necessary. Once you have the file open and ready to
configure, we need to make sure it has the following lines:</p>
<pre>
<code>
# This are the proxy settings we use for activator
-Dhttp.proxyHost=PUT YOUR PROXY HOST HERE
-Dhttp.proxyPort=PUT YOUR PROXY PORT HERE
# Here we configure the hosts which should not go through the proxy.  You should include your private network, if applicable.
-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts="localhost|127.0.0.1"
# These are commented out, but if you need to use authentication for your proxy, please fill these out.
#-Dhttp.proxyUser=PUT YOUR PROXY USER HERE
#-Dhttp.proxyPassword=PUT YOUR PROXY PASSWORD HERE
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Increasing the Network Timeout</h3>
<p>By default Activator has a 10 second timeout to fetch the latest
templates and check for a new version. On slow internet connections
it might be necessary to increase that timeout. You can do that
from the command line by including a
<code>-Dactivator.timeout=30s</code> parameter or by putting that
parameter into your <code>~/.activator/activatorconfig.txt</code>
file.</p>
